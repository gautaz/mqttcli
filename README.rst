    export MQTT_BROKER="wss://mqtt.somewhere.io:9443"
    export MQTT_USERNAME="user"
    export MQTT_PASSWORD="blahblah"

or by using a config file. You can specify a config file with the ``--conf`` option. or automatically load from ``~/.mqttcli.cfg``.

::

  % mqttcli sub --conf yoursettings.json -t "some/topic"

example:

::

   {
     "broker": "wss://mqtt.somewhere.io:9443",
     "username": "user",
     "password": "blahblah"
   }

If you use AWS IoT, you can use these JSON as mqttcli config file, such as

::

   {
     "broker": "wss://A3HVHEAALED.iot.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com:8883",
     "clientId": "something",
     "thingName": "something",
     "caCert": "path/to/root-CA.crt",
     "clientCert": "path/to/2a338xx2xxf-certificate.pem.crt",
     "privateKey": "path/to/aad380efffx-private.pem.key"
   }

You may change cert files path to where you placed.

Pub
-------

::

  mqttcli pub -t "some/where" -m "your message"

  or

  tail -f /var/log/nginx.log | mqttcli pub -t "some/where" -s

`-s` is diffrent from mosquitto_pub, it sends one line to one message.

Sub
------

::

  mqttcli sub -t "some/#"


PubSub
---------

Note: This subcommand is just a concept work. Might be delete in the future.

Publish from stdin AND Subscribe from some topics and print stdout.

::

  tail -f /vag/log/nginx.log | mqttcli pubsub --pub "some/a" --sub "some/#" > filterd.log

This is useful when other client manuplate something and send back to
the topic.
